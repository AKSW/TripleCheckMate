Linked Data Quality Evaluation software

This software was developed as a general purpose tool for Linked Data Quality Evaluation.
It's first use was for DBpedia but (almost) everything is configurable or can easily change.

In the future it will be shipped with an h2 database inside the war file as a ready to go tool but till then you can also use MySQL or (hopefully) any JDBC enabled database. The default database file is in war/db/database.default.sql

The software was built with Google Web Toolkit
