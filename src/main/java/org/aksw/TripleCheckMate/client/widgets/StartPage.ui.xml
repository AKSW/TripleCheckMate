				<h2>What is it about?</h2>
				<p>Welcome to the DBpedia Evaluation Campaign. This campaign aims at
					evaluating DBpedia resources in order to assess and thereby improve
					the quality of DBpedia.</p>
				<h2>How does it work?</h2>
				<p>First, please authenticate yourself with a google account. This
					will not only help prevent spam but also help us keep track of how
					many resources you evaluated. After you click “Start”, you will be
					provided with a list of classes from DBpedia wherein you may choose
					the ones you are most familiar with. There are three options: (1)
					Any: where a completely random resource will be retrieved, (2)
					Class: where you have the option to choose any class from the
					DBpedia ontology and a random resource belonging to that class will
					be retrieved, (3) Manual: where you can manually put in the DBpedia
					URI of a resource of your choice.</p>
				<p>After selecting a resource, you will be shown each triple
					belonging to that resource on a single row. You need to look at
					each
					triple and evaluate whether it contains an error or not. If it
					contains an error, check the box “has error”. Then, you need to
					choose an error type from a list. If the error type does not match
					any of the existing types, you have the option to provide a new
					type
					in the “Comments” field. Optionally, you may also write the
					correct
					form of the triple in the “Comments” field.
				</p>
				<p>You need to evaluate a minimum of 3 resources. Evaluating one
					resource may take about 10 - 15 minutes, on average. You need to
					finish evaluating one resource in one session. You can come back
					later and evaluate another one. After evaluating one entire
					resource, click on “Submit”. You should receive a confirmation
					message.</p>
				<h2>How is it going to help?</h2>
				<p>The more the resources you evaluate, the more errors will be
					detected. These errors will then be recorded and analyzed by our
					team. Based on whether the error is fixable or not, we will amend
					DBpedia to ensure that the next versions do not have the same types
					of errors.</p>
				<h2>What do you get?</h2>
				<p>In order to thank you for your contributions, a lucky winner will
					win either a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 or an Amazon voucher worth 300
					EU!
					So, go ahead, start evaluating now!</p>
